# SupplyChainManagement
Supplychain Management system built on Etherium smart contract using web3, NodeJS and React for front end

This project is focused on leveraging the power of blockchain technology to create a more efficient and transparent supply chain management system.

Our goal is to develop a platform that allows for the secure and decentralized tracking of goods as they move through the supply chain, from production to delivery. By using blockchain, we aim to provide real-time visibility and accountability at every stage of the process, reducing the risk of fraud and errors.

The project is built using the Ethereum blockchain and is designed to be easily scalable and customizable to fit the needs of a wide range of industries.
